# 🚨 ScanNest: The Web3 Scam Detection Protocol

> "Protecting the next wave of crypto investors — one flag at a time."

---

## 🧠 The Problem

Scam ICOs are everywhere. Smart contracts with hidden backdoors. Fake founders. Overhyped tokens with zero fundamentals. New investors don’t stand a chance — and current tools aren’t built for them.

---

## 🛡️ Our Vision

ScanNest is building a **real-time detection engine** to identify fraudulent crypto projects before they cause damage.

Our system goes **beyond surface-level checks** — combining on-chain analytics, off-chain verification, and machine learning into a unified threat scoring engine.

---

## 🔍 What It Will Do

- Analyze **smart contract risk** and **wallet behavior**
- Detect **anomalies** in tokenomics and liquidity moves
- Evaluate whitepapers, teams, and domain legitimacy
- Generate a **Scam Risk Score** for every ICO
- Trigger alerts for suspicious behavior
- Help users decide: *“Is this safe?”*

---

## 🔧 Developer Opportunity

We’re building this as a **DAO-powered protocol** — early contributors will receive **DAO shares**, rewards, and reputation-based governance.

We're currently looking for:

- Solidity/Cairo smart contract security nerds
- ML/AI developers with interest in anomaly detection
- Fullstack types who love dashboards + real-time alerts
- StarkNet ecosystem explorers who want to shape something big

---

## 🌐 Why Join?

- Work on **real-world Web3 security**
- Build on a stack that blends AI + crypto + community
- Shape the first DAO-native scam detection framework
- Get in early — grow with the protocol

## 📍 Status

We're in early MVP mode. You won’t just be coding — you’ll help **design the backbone of Web3 trust.**
